# MicroServicesArquetype
Exercise of microservices.
 
The exercise was developed following baeldungs spring cloud stutorial series at http://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-tutorial and covers the next tutorials:
 
>> Bootstrapping the Spring Cloud Application Here, we’re building a base we can use for building more complex applications.  
>> Spring Cloud Configuration A quick intro to using a git repository as a storage for our project configuration.  
>> Securing Spring Cloud Services We now have a cloud application with security around our services. Using Zuul and Spring Session we can log users in only one service and propagate that authentication to our entire application.  
>> Tracing Services with Zipkin Zipkin can provide us with much-needed information on where requests are spending their time. This can help us determine where things are slowing down and indicate what areas of our application need improvement.  
>> Spring Cloud – Adding Angular See how easy it’s to integrate a single page app into the system.
